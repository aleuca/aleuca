### Greetings! 🦒 🌴 🏄‍♀️

My name's Al! I used to be a web developer, but these days I rarely work on new projects.

I work for https://www.sourceful.com/, and we are hiring!
- We source and design sustainable packaging for businesses (ex: coffee cups ☕, shipping boxes 🗃️, bouquet wrapping 💐) so that businesses can have beautiful and planet-friendly materials 🌍.
- Based in UK, but most of our team is fully remote 🏖️
- We mainly use Node + React, but our hiring is language-agnostic 🗣 ✔️
- Shoot me an email if you're interested in joining the team! 🦾
