### Greetings! 🦒 🌴 🏄‍♀️

My name's Al! I used to be a web developer, but these days I rarely work on new projects.

I work for https://grover.com, and we are hiring!
- We rent out all sorts of tech equipment (ex: laptops 💻, cellphones 📱, e-scooters 🛵) so that individuals and businesses don't have to invest in buying expensive stuff 💰.
- Based in Berlin, but most of our team is fully remote 🏖️
- We mainly use Node + React, but our hiring is language-agnostic 🗣 ✔️
- Shoot me an email if you're interested in joining the team! 🦾
